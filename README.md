# inspec_tools_action
THIS ACTION IS DEPRECATED. Use the [SAF Action](https://github.com/mitre/saf_action) instead.
GitHub Action for [Inspec Tools](https://github.com/mitre/inspec_tools)

## Input and Output Arguments
### Input
#### `command` (required)

One of the available commands from Inspec Tools.

**Note:** This action only supports the `compliance` and `summary` subcommands of Inspec Tools.

* `summary`: Parses an Inspec results JSON and displays the summary information from all of the tests that were run.
* `compliance`: Parses an Inspec results JSON to check if the compliance level meets a specified threshold. If the specified threshold is not met, an error code (1) is returned along with non-compliant elements.

#### `resultsfile` (required)

Filename of the file that contains the Inspec results JSON to examine.

#### `thresholdfile` (required)

Filename of the file that contains the Inspec Tools-format threshold file.

An example of the format of this file is found on the Inspec Tools [README](https://github.com/mitre/inspec_tools#yaml-file-or-in-line-threshold-definition-styles)

### Output

#### Status Codes

This action will report a non-zero exit code if the command did not meet the thresholds set in `thresholdfile` input.

## Example

This action is useful for validating IT infrastructure as code or infrastructure hardening code fixes security controls/compliance findings or does not open any new security controls or compliance issues.

Typical Steps:
* Push new feature to infrastructure as code repository
* Build new test infrastructure based off of previous step
* Validate test infrastructure meets compliance requirements with Inspec
* Use this action to define and enforce minimum thresholds for infrastructure compliance by requiring checks to pass in a pull request review
